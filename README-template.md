Users should be able to:

- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- TailwindCSS
- Vue.JS



### What I learned

I've learned how to create multi-step things.



### Continued development

I still need to make my code look cleaner and much more versatile. Perhaps some of things could land on as a component.
